# Project Documents: Part A

Come up with a concept for your application.

The concept for our application is based on education. We are looking to build an application in the form of a game that can track data from gameplay to show the progress of any given user. Our target audience for this application is currently for people with Autism/Alzheimers. We are seeking to develop an application that can improve a learning disability of either of these groups of people. Collectively with the stakeholders who are; researchers, instructors, developers (designers), users and parents, we believe that we can build something that is beneficial and impactful to the audience we are seeking to reach out to. 
Create an initial set of project requirements expressed as user stories. Make sure to identify all the relevant project stakeholders.

Users (game player)- play the game to be entertained

Instructor/Client (Chipidza)- attain some value to utilize in a specific endeavor

Developer & designer (us)- bring the vision into fruition and ensure the code is aligned with design vision as well

Admin (parents)- for children to have fun while learning and track their progress

Researcher (subject matter expert)- to provide subject matter expert information to be shown in the application and ensure it is implemented correctly, also to provide a reference to explain how and why certain games within the game are being showcased

# The user stories must have estimates of completion times

* To be updated according to iterations*
