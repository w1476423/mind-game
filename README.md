# The concept for our application

The concept for our application is based on education. We are looking to build an application in the form of a game 
that can track data from gameplay to show the progress of any given user. Our target audience for this application is 
currently for people who want to enhance memorization ability. We are seeking to develop an application that can potentially improve a learning disability. Collectively with the stakeholders who are; researchers, instructors, 
developers (designers), users and parents, we believe that we can build something that is beneficial and impactful to 
the audience we are seeking to reach out to.
