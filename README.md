# Team SWAG (Team3) Educational game project 

# The concept for our application

The concept for our application is based on education. We are looking to build an application in the form of a game 
that can track data from gameplay to show the progress of any given user. Our target audience for this application is 
currently for people with Autism/Alzheimers. We are seeking to develop an application that can improve a learning 
disability of either of these groups of people. Collectively with the stakeholders who are; researchers, instructors, 
developers (designers), users and parents, we believe that we can build something that is beneficial and impactful to 
the audience we are seeking to reach out to.
